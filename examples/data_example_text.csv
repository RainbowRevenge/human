They will probably not get a landing permit from the man in the moon. The right for asylum does not apply here.'	What kind of horrible comments people post here. Very disturbing, only populist and right-wing views, Salvini and Trump should be shot to the moon without a return ticket. Resist the beginnings!'	{‘outlet’: ‘focus’}
"I wrote exactly the same thing and got censored! Why does no one actually write that only rich migrants are ""saved""? The saved people payed 1000€ per person to board the rubber dinghy. Is this also going to be censored now?"	It's simply a wrong word. It's transporting people to Europe. They have never been in distress at sea and have payed a lot of money to board the ships. Why are they always claiming wrong facts? The press should be more objective, otherwise it has nothing to do with Journalism.	{‘outlet’: ‘focus’}
Without judging the numbers presented and your statement... but a tightening of the asylum laws would also be a change in asylum laws...	88% of Germans are supporting a change of asylum laws. I suspect that they accidentaly wrote the percentage sign. It's more likely to be 88 Germans that support this. Everything else has nothing to do with reality. Otherwise I'll just claim now that 99.99% are for a tightening of the asylum laws.	{‘outlet’: ‘focus’}
we cannot save the world!!! We must provide aid in the countries of origin! Helping people help themselves!! Otherwise we will drown!	Yes, on and on! We as the responsible world police will accept anyone that is on their way to Germany anyways. Our social system makes it possible. We will continue to do so until the barrel overflows and the people are finally fed up. Who is now actually  dividing our society?	{‘outlet’: ‘focus’}
Simply use a tracking app to look up the trajectory of the ship, then it will be clear that the refugees were directly guided towards the sea.	"even more, they were faster than the Lybians to arrive for the ""rescue at sea"", that makes it clear for me that this is human trafficking. Salvini should use military ships to guide the German ship back to where it picked up the asylum seekers and then towards the nearest port. Then send the German NGO the bill. Salvini will not let the Italian NGO ship enter its port, embark the passengers onto the war ship and then back to North Africa. Rackete has set a precedent on how to enter a port using extortion and violence, despite the prohibition, that shows the high levels of criminality of these trafickers, that are being called good people and saints here... Saving lives can also be done differently!"	{‘outlet’: ‘focus’}
